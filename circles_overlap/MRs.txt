1.	Input MR1: Translate both circles by the same amount in any direction (translation vector translation vector (3, -2))
	Output MR1: The expected output should be = to the output of  actual input		
2.	"Input MR2: Relationship of reflecting both circles across the x-axis, we'll transform the y-coordinates of the circle centers by negating them. This means each point (x, y) becomes (x, -y).		"
