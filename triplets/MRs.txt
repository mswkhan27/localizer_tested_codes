1.	Input MR1: After permuting the elements of the array it will display the same pairs of numbers.	
	Output MR1: The expected output should be = to the output of  actual input.	

2.	Input MR2:If I compute the symmetric for each element in an array, the number of pairs or triplets whose sum equals zero remains unchanged, except that the sign of each element is reversed.		
	  Output MR2: The expected output should be = to the output of  actual input but with opposite sings.

3.	Input MR3: Multiply each digit of the array by 2.
	Output MR3: The expected output should be = to the output of  actual input multiplyed by 2.
